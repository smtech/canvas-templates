# Canvas Templates

An add-on to allow users to create, manage and use templates for objects in Canvas, particularly assignments, discussions and pages. The basic concept is that all templates are objects whose name ends in [TEMPLATE], and that the user is presented with a list of templates on their front page that they can duplicate at will.

As an interesting sidenote, in response to a query in the Canvas Community, I slapped together a screencast taking this repository from Github to working in Canvas.
